🏡 Homie — Shared Living Made Simple
I&E Project — Team 4 (Abeera, Cheuk Ying, Lamia, Qaisar)

Homie is an early-stage web prototype designed to make shared living easier, fairer, and more organized. It helps households manage tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities without the usual confusion and conflict.

This repository contains the interactive UI prototype, implemented using TypeScript pages. The visual flow demonstrates how the final app will function.
The full production-ready app is currently under development.

🎯 Purpose

Shared living can get messy — especially when responsibilities aren’t clearly assigned. Homie addresses the most common pain points:

Unclear ownership of chores

Uneven contribution among roommates

Missed deadlines and forgotten tasks

Communication gaps that lead to frustration

Homie brings structure and transparency to every shared household.

✨ Key Features (Prototype)
✔️ Clear Task Assignment

Everyone knows what they’re responsible for and when they need to do it.

✔️ Contribution Log

Tracks who completed what, providing a fair and transparent record of work.

✔️ Shared Calendar & Reminders

Keeps the entire household aligned with deadlines and reminders.

✔️ Real-Time Household Overview

A simple dashboard showing members, tasks, and progress at a glance.

🖼️ Prototype Screens Included in This Repo

This prototype includes TypeScript pages representing the core user flow:

1. Add Household

The starting point: users create their household (e.g., Coloc) to begin organizing tasks.

2. Household Dashboard

A structured overview with:

Member list

Task list

Options to add or manage items

3. Add Member

A simple form allowing users to add people and optionally assign roles.

4. Add Task

Allows creating a task with:

Task title

Assigned member

Deadline (mandatory)

This gives clarity and eliminates overlapping responsibilities.

🛠️ Tech Stack (Prototype)

TypeScript

HTML/CSS

Simple modular UI components

⚠️ Note: This is a UI-only prototype — no backend, authentication, or data storage is included.

🚧 Current Status

This repository showcases a functional prototype.
The full app (with complete logic, real-time updates, and a proper backend) is under development in the next phase of the project.

📦 How to Run the Prototype

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mesyeux/i-e-25
